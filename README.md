Statistical-Learning
====================
In this mini-project, I implemented logistic regression and then normalized logistic regression.
I also did a couple of scripts which do 5-fold cross validation on a dataset (which is there).

In order to test the model and see the results, just run crossValidationForLogisticRegression (in order to see the error rate and
the results of classification for Logistic Regression) or run crossValidationForRidgeRegression (in order to see the error rate 
and the results of classification for Regularized Logistic Regression).

In order to see how the code is implemented just look at the functions there.

The project was motivated from an assignment on statistical learning, at the uni where I study.
